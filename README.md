# Scrap Lens üîç

A powerful AI-powered image segmentation tool built with SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2) that allows you to intelligently segment and analyze images.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Segmentation**: Uses Meta's SAM2 model for precise image segmentation
- **Interactive Selection**: Click to select objects or draw bounding boxes
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast segmentation with immediate visual feedback
- **Multiple Input Modes**: Support for file uploads and image URLs
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI service with SAM2 integration
- **AI Model**: Meta's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Python 3.8+ and pip
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for optimal performance)
